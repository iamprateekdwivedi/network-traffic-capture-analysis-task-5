Cyber Security Internship Task 5 - Wireshark-Network-Capture-Analysis
This repository contains the deliverables for task 5 of the cybersecurity intenship, which involved capturing and analyzing live network traffice using wireshark.    # Objective      
Capture live network packets and identify basic network protocols such as ICMP, TCP and HTTP.                                                                         # Tools Used
Wireshark (packet capturing and analysis)                                                                                                                             ## Protocols Identified  
**ICMP:** Used for network diagnostics such as ping requests.
**TCP:** A connection oriented protocol ensuring reliable data transfer.
**HTTP:** Protocol for web traffic, handling website request and responses.                                                                                          ## Deliverables
A packet capture file (.pcap) contaning the capture network traffic.
